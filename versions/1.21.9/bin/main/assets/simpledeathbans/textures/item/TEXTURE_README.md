# Texture Placeholder

This folder should contain: `resurrection_totem.png`

The texture should be a 16x16 pixel PNG file.

Suggested design:
- A glowing golden totem with purple/dark accents
- Similar style to the vanilla Totem of Undying but with darker, more ominous colors
- Consider adding small soul-fire effects or netherite-colored borders

You can create this texture using:
- Aseprite
- GIMP
- Piskel (free online pixel art editor)
- Or any other image editor

Place the completed `resurrection_totem.png` file in this directory:
`src/main/resources/assets/simpledeathbans/textures/item/`
